  <h1 class="about-mrsg-manipal-r">
    About MRSG<br /><br />Manipal Robotics Support Group (or MRSG for short) is the largest community of robotics <br />enthusiasts in
    Manipal, comprising students, alumni and professors working in the field of <br />robotics and automation and its related fields. Our
    main aim is to provide a welcoming space <br />to learn new skills and collaborate with other community members on projects,
    encompassing <br />a vast demographic ranging from complete beginners to seasoned veterans.<br /><br />MRSG started in June 2021, when a
    group of students and alumni from Manipal Institute of <br />Technology, Manipal, got together to grow a community of like-minded
    robotics enthusiasts <br />to create a platform with low barriers of entry for anyone seeking to dip their toes into the
    <br />ever-changing field of robotics and automation, after seeing new heights of interest in robotic <br />process applications during
    the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary focus was on increasing <br />accessibility of knowledge pertaining the to more esoteric topics of
    the focal trinity of Artificial <br />Intelligence, Electronics and Control Systems, and Design and Modelling, while also endeavouring
    <br />to introduce more students to the possibilities of the sector.<br /><br />Apart from maintaining an active Discord server for
    members to interact with each other, we also <br />hold regular workshops and events collaborating with many renowned technical clubs in
    Manipal. <br />We also maintain a blog for members to publish technical articles, giving them an opportunity to <br />sharpen their
    research and writing skills.<br /><br />Reach Out<br /><br />If you’d like to reach out to us to join us as a member, or for
    collaborations, submitting any <br />technical articles, etc. you may reach out to us through any of these channels:
